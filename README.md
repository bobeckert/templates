# Templates

Foiled by not having templates, I started collecting them.

## Getting Started

They are templates.  Just read them.  No further build or deploy needed.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You need a way to view text, like you're doing... right. now.
```

### Installing

Copy and edit to suit.  There's no right or wrong way, unless they aren't in the top level of your thing.  Don't make us dig for documentation.

## Running the tests

There are no tests.  

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
